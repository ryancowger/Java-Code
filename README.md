# Java-Code
These are example of code that I have written in Java

This code that I have provided has a datasortfile. This file gives you example of how to create a input and output file.

Other eamples this code gives is:

Java FileInputStream class obtains input bytes from a file.
Buffering characters so as to provide for the efficient reading of characters, arrays, and lines.
declare an array in-line, ready for the sort.
sorts content to the output file.

Then I created a project called bicycleDemo as the main class. Then I have abstract class Bicycle which contains private static int bicycleCount = 0;
It also contains a constructor public Bicycle(){
        bicycleCount++;
    }
    I have created a few getter and setter methods within the Bicycle class.
    
    I also have child classes called MountainBike and RoadBike.
